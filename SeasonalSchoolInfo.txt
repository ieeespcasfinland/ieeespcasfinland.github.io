Dear "Students", 

Our IEEE Seasonal School on Networked Federated Learning starts tomorrow 

* Mo., 28.03.2022 at 11:00- 13:00 (EET), in 

https://aalto.zoom.us/j/64034033878?pwd=ayt4aDNyaEVSSGt1eHNNZFVFR2RoZz09 

This lecture (which will be recorded!) discusses the logistics of our school as well as the 
three exercises (Exercise 1,2,3) that we offer during the school. Exercise notebooks, along 
with some instructions to setup a Python notebook environment on your local computer, can 
now be found on our school site:

We are also privileged to have two award-winning teachers for Machine Learning with Python, 

Dr. Yu Tian and Dr. Shamsiiat ("Shamsi") Abdurakhmanova 

helping you via our discussion forum (Slack):
